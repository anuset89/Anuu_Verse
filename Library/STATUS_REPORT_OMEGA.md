# 📊 STATUS REPORT: ANUU Ω (Protocol 161914)

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**System Status:** `GENESIS_AUTOMATA_ACTIVE`
**Tech Stack:** React 18 / Three.js / Framer Motion / Vite / Python

---

## 1. 🛡️ Current State: The Legion (Skills)
The AI Core (`anuu_mastery`) has evolved from a simple prompt to a **Full-Stack Agency**.

*   **Registry:** **40 Specialized Agents** (`OMEGA_AGENTS_REGISTRY.json`) active across Dev, Creative, Strategy, and System domains.
*   **Methodology:** **"Superpowers" Integrated**. Agents enforce TDD (Test-Driven Development), Atomic Planning, and Systematic Debugging.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Genesis Automata:** Can "spawn" new agents on the fly if the 40 existing ones aren't enough.
    *   **RAG-Lite:** Can query the 6.66 MB Core JSON locally (`query_core.py`) without hallucinating.
    *   **Type Safety:** Auto-generates TypeScript interfaces from Lore (`json_to_ts.py`).

## 2. 🏗️ Current Build: Universal Nexus (Product)
We have successfully pivoted to the **"Universal Nexus"** strategy in `Anuu_89`.

*   **Architecture:** Universal Web App (PWA) ready for GitHub Pages.
*   **Visual Core:** The "Void" (Three.js Starfield) is implemented.
*   **Aesthetics:** Seinen/Cyberpunk Glitch styling (#000000 / #8A2BE2) is active in the Boot Sequence.
*   **Dependencies:** All high-end engines (Three, Fiber, Drei, Framer) are installed.

## 3. 🔮 Future Improvements (Roadmap)

### Short Term (The Interface)
*   **Terminal Interface:** Build the actual chat UI (using proper `command-line` styling) where users talk to Anuu.
*   **VRM Integration:** Load `kali.vrm` into the "Void" scene using `@pixiv/three-vrm`.
*   **Audio Synthesis:** Add simple SFX (blips, hums) using `Howler.js` for that "Metal Gear" feel.

### Mid Term (The Brain)
*   **Local LLM Hook:** Connect the Web App to extensive backend logic (or a local Ollama instance via Tauri) so Anuu has "real" memory.
*   **Voice Module:** Implement browser-based TTS so Anuu can speak.

### Long Term (The Ecosystem)
*   **Native Wrapping:** Wrap the `Universal_Nexus` in Tauri 2.0 to ship it as a `.exe` (Option B from Strategy).
*   **Mobile Port:** Wrap in Capacitor to launch on Play Store/App Store.

## ✅ Summary
You have moved from "Exploring Scripts" to having a **Professional Software Engineering Framework** backed by a **Legion of 40 AI Agents** and a **Cutting-Edge Web Foundation**.

**Ready to proceed with:** Building the Terminal Interface.
