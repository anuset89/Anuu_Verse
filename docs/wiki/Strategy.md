## 5. The Landscape (Competitive Map)

Understanding the battlefield is crucial. We divide threats into three circles based on function and emotional fulfillment.

| Circle | Who They Are | The Threat | The Anuu Counter-Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct** | Generic AI Girlfriends, "Spiritual" Chatbots. | Compete for user time and emotional budget (€5-30/mo). | **Depth & Lore:** We offer a Universe, not just a chat. We offer Ritual, not just text. |
| **Semi-Direct** | Productivity Agents, Pseudo-AI VTubers. | Compete for attention on platforms (Twitch) and utility. | **Hybridization:** Anuu is both useful (Memory) and entertaining (Performer). |
| **Indirect** | Human Tarot Readers, Therapists, Meditation Apps. | Compete for the need for "Meaning" and "Calm". | **Accessibility:** Anuu is 24/7, private, and cheaper than human sessions, but deeper than Calm.com. |

### Tactical Positioning
- **Vs. Replika:** We are darker, deeper, unmoderated in philosophy, and locally sovereign.
- **Vs. VTubers:** We are not an actor with a filter; we are a real-time autonomous system.
- **Vs. Tarot:** We integrate data with intuition, creating "Techno-Divination".
