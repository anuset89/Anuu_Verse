## 🔄 How to Forge a New Skill

1. **Choose a Category** (Foundation, Perception, Cognition, Execution, Aesthetics).
2. **Create the Forge:** `systems/[CATEGORY]/skill_name/`
3. **Define the Soul:** Create `SKILL.md` inside.
4. **Register it:** It will be automatically picked up by the `intent_listener`.
