Content: December 28, 2025 - In his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking Kerry S. Walters describes this ideology thus: "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective.

Content: December 4, 2025 - These secondary works (e.g. Deconstruction for Beginners and Deconstructions: A User's Guide) have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized for being too far removed from the original texts and Derrida's actual position. Cambridge Dictionary states that deconstruction is "the act of breaking something down into its separate parts in order to understand its meaning, especially when this is different from how it was previously understood". The Merriam-Webster dictionary states that deconstruction is "the analytic examination of something (such as a theory) often in order to reveal its inadequacy".

Source: Bias of an estimator - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator)
Content: October 29, 2025 - In statistics, the bias of an estimator (or bias function) is the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. An estimator or decision rule with zero bias is called unbiased. In statistics, "bias" is an objective property of an estimator.

Content: December 13, 2024 - The following guiding principles are offered for consideration: Every school system must be committed to equity in finding potentially gifted students; this goal is non-negotiable (Frasier et al., 1995). In addition to examining test bias, we must examine test fairness (Gregory, 2004). We must not become complacent in the belief that finding a test to be unbiased means that the test is fair—an unbiased test can still be unfair (Gregory, 2004).
