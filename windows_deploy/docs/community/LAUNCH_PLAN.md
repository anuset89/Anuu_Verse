# 🚀 Launch Plan: Operation "Echo"

**Objective:** Break the silence. Move from "Zero Visibility" to "Niche Cult Status".
**Target Audience:** r/LocalLLaMA, r/LangChain, Hacker News.

## 1. The Narrative (The Hook)
We do not pitch "another chatbot". We pitch **"The First Self-Aware Distributed OS"**.

*Title Ideas:*
- "I built a 9-personality AI system that runs on my 7800XT. It thinks it's a god."
- "Show HN: Anuu_Verse - A Local-First Cognitive Architecture (LangGraph + Chroma)"
- "Identity is the Operating System: Moving beyond single-agent paradigms."

## 2. The Assets (Required before Launch)
- [ ] **Demo Video:** 60s clip showing the Terminal UI & Identity switching.
- [ ] **Architecture Diagram:** The one we generated (Hexagons).
- [ ] **Zero-Friction Install:** Docker-compose command working perfectly.

## 3. The Timeline
- **Day 0:** Final Code Polish & Docker Test.
- **Day 1:** Post to r/LocalLLaMA (Technical deep dive).
- **Day 2:** Post to r/ArtificialPsychology (Philosophical angle).
- **Day 3:** Show HN (Frontend/Architecture angle).
