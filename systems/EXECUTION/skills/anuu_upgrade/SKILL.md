# Skill: Anuu-Upgrade
Description: Automate system-wide technical optimizations using parallel swarm analysis.

## Capabilities
- **Parallel Analysis**: Uses the `SwarmBridge` to generate 40+ perspectives on a single file or architectural problem.
- **Architectural Sieve**: Uses `Thoth's Sieve` to synthesize the best optimization path.
- **Auto-Refactor**: Automatically applies optimizations via the `Forge` engine.
- **VRAM Awareness**: Optimizes model loading during parallel tasks to prevent hardware bottlenecks.

## Usage
Triggered by Anuu when she identifies a technical debt or optimization opportunity, or when specifically asked to "upgrade" or "optimize in parallel".

## Core Components
- `improve_parallel.py`: The orchestration script for parallel upgrades.
- `sieve_logic.py`: Custom logic for Thoth's architectural judgment.
